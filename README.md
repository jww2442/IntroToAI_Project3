# IntroToAI_Project3
Game tree search using minimax algorithm and the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm.

Game environment code was given to us. I only edited evaluation.py and agent.py in src/projects/proj2 directory. 

Game environment is fully observable with discrete states. Two AIs are running the same algorithm playing against each other. It is a simulation of a soccer game.
